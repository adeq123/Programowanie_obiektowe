{12307}{12361}Does it get better than this?
{12378}{12436}Question: You're not dating, are you?
{12442}{12504}I met somebody who would be|perfect for you.
{12515}{12566}You see, perfect might be a problem.
{12572}{12657}Had you said co-dependent|or self-destructive. . . .
{12675}{12728}-You want a date Saturday?|-Yes, please.
{12775}{12803}He is cute.
{12809}{12861}-He's funny. He's--|-He's a he?

{14324}{14417}It's hard to enjoy Ramen noodles|after that. Is that ridiculous?
{14423}{14485}Can you believe she actually|thought that?
{14614}{14676}When I first met you,|I thought maybe. . .
{14682}{14708}. . .possibly. . .
{14714}{14739}. . .you might be.
{14770}{14790}You did?
{14796}{14876}Then you spent Phoebe's birthday|party talking to my breasts. . .
{14882}{14925}. . .so then I figured maybe not.
{14966}{15085}Did any of the rest of you guys|think that when you first met me?
{15090}{15117}-I did.|-I think so.
{15182}{15231}-Not me.|-No, no, me neither.
{15252}{15331}Although back in college,|Susan Saladore did.
{15337}{15372}You're kidding.
{15383}{15434}-Did you tell her I wasn't?|-No.
{15464}{15526}It's because I wanted|to go out with her too.
{15531}{15613}So I told her, actually,|you were seeing Bernie Spellman. . .
{15674}{15705}. . .who also liked her.
{15825}{15870}Well, this is fascinating.
{15889}{15930}So what is it about me?
{15947}{16025}I don't know. Because you're smart,|you're funny. . . .
{16031}{16087}So is Ross.|You ever think that about him?
{16097}{16118}Yeah, right!
{16131}{16157}What is it?
{16208}{16283}I don't know. You just--|You have a quality.
{16289}{16310}Yes, exactly.
{16316}{16350}Yeah, a quality.
{16367}{16465}''A quality. '' Good. I was worried|you were gonna be vague about this.
{16646}{16686}It's Paolo calling from Rome.
{16692}{16762}Oh, my God! Calling from Rome!
{16886}{16956}So he's calling from Rome.|I could do that.
{16969}{17008}Just gotta go to Rome.
{17076}{17141}Your Dad just beeped in.|Can you make it quick?
{17147}{17185}I'm talking to Rome.
{17206}{17244}I'm talking to Rome.
{17271}{17309}Hey, Dad. What's up?
{17357}{17385}Oh, God.
{17424}{17459}Ross, it's Nana.
{17741}{17782}-How you doing?|-Hey, Dad.
{17876}{17899}How's she doing?
{17917}{17975}The doctor says|it's a matter of hours.
{17989}{18056}-How are you, Mom?|-Me? I'm fine, fine.
{18062}{18106}I'm glad you're here.
{18147}{18180}What's with your hair?
{18186}{18213}What?
{18231}{18251}What's different?
{18262}{18284}Nothing.
{18297}{18346}Oh, maybe that's it.
{18366}{18403}She's unbelievable.|Her mother's--
{18408}{18439}Okay, relax.
{18444}{18505}We are gonna be here a while,|it looks like.
{18510}{18578}We still have boyfriends|and your career to cover.
{18586}{18616}Oh, God!
{18778}{18860}The fuzzy little mints|at the bottom of her purse.
{18881}{18932}Yeah, they were gross.
{18952}{18995}You know what I love?
{19000}{19044}Her Sweet 'N Lows.
{19049}{19126}How she was always stealing them|from restaurants.
{19132}{19205}Not just from restaurants,|from our house.
{19223}{19243}Mrs. Geller?
{19387}{19419}She looks so small.
{19430}{19455}I know.
{19482}{19565}Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop|and Aunt Phyllis now.
{19656}{19693}Goodbye, Nana.
{19869}{19889}Bye, Nana.
{20049}{20075}Nurse!
{20111}{20143}What is going on?
{20164}{20230}You know how the nurse said|Nana had passed?
{20235}{20272}Well, she's not quite.
{20311}{20331}What?
{20336}{20427}She's not passed!|She's present! She's back!
{20436}{20463}What's going on?
{20469}{20509}She may have died.
{20529}{20560}''She may have died''?
{20566}{20597}We're looking into it.
{20644}{20681}I'll go see.
{20755}{20796}This almost never happens.
{21215}{21266}Now she's passed.
{21499}{21552}I just have to know, okay?
{21566}{21596}Is it my hair?
{21610}{21683}Yes, that's exactly what it is.|It's your hair.
{21689}{21741}Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
{21907}{21938}So did she. . .?
{21952}{21983}Twice.
{22035}{22075}Oh, that sucks.
{22130}{22156}You guys okay?
{22167}{22206}I don't know. It's weird.
{22212}{22296}I know she's gone,|but I just don't feel. . . .
{22304}{22349}Maybe she's not really gone.
{22354}{22390}No, no, she's gone.
{22412}{22443}We checked.
{22454}{22479}A lot.
{22512}{22581}No, I mean, maybe no one|ever really goes.
{22587}{22656}Ever since my mom died,|every now and then. . .
{22662}{22752}. . .I get this feeling that she's,|like, right here, you know?
{22849}{22910}And Debbie, my best friend|from junior high. . .
{22915}{22990}. . .got struck by lightning|on a miniature golf course.
{23022}{23081}I always get this strong|Debbie vibe. . .
{23087}{23145}. . .whenever I use|a little yellow pencil.
{23269}{23288}I miss her.
{23317}{23346}Here, Pheebs.
{23352}{23376}Want this?
{23382}{23431}-Oh, thanks.|-Sure.
{23437}{23490}I just sharpened her this morning.
{23545}{23620}I don't believe any of that.|I think when you're dead. . .
{23626}{23686}. . .you're dead. You're gone.|You're worm food.
{23789}{23830}So Chandler looks gay, huh?
{23932}{24000}I don't know who this is,|but it's not Debbie.
{24184}{24230}I thought it'd be a closed casket.
{24235}{24306}Well, that doesn't mean|she can't look nice.
{24424}{24486}Sweetie, you think|you can get in there?
{24496}{24537}I don't see why not.
{24997}{25025}Here's my retainer!
{25254}{25294}I was just thinking. . .
{25302}{25347}-. . .when my time comes--|-Dad!
{25353}{25382}Listen to me!
{25422}{25513}When my time comes,|I wanna be buried at sea.
{25580}{25600}You what?
{25622}{25699}I wanna be buried at sea.|It looks like fun.
{25754}{25785}Define ''fun. ''
{25790}{25889}Come on. You'll make a day of it.|You'll get a boat, pack a lunch. . . .
{25896}{26000}And then we throw your body in|the water. Gee, that does sound fun.
{26005}{26041}Everyone thinks they know me.
{26047}{26121}Everyone says, ''Jack Geller,|so predictable. ''
{26127}{26241}Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say,|''Buried at sea? Huh. ''
{26322}{26372}That's probably what they'll say.
{26385}{26423}I'd like that.
{26709}{26729}Hey, gorgeous.
{26770}{26836}Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.
{26842}{26945}Don't worry about it. Apparently,|other people have made the same mistake.
{26975}{27016}Okay. Phew!
{27084}{27148}So what do you think it is about me?
{27176}{27205}I don't know what.
{27210}{27255}You just have. . .
{27260}{27305}-. . .a quality.|-A quality. Great.
{27317}{27406}It's a shame, because you and Lowell|would've made a great couple.
{27450}{27549}Lowell? Financial Services Lowell?|That's who you saw me with?
{27556}{27582}What? He's cute.
{27588}{27620}Well, yeah.
{27629}{27678}He's no Brian in Payroll.
{27750}{27775}Is Brian. . .?
{27781}{27865}I don't know. The point is,|if you were gonna set me up. . .
{27870}{27939}. . .I'd like to think it'd be|with somebody like him.
{27944}{28004}I think Brian's|a little out of your league.
{28127}{28221}Excuse me. You don't think|I could get a Brian?
{28292}{28371}Because I could get a Brian.|Believe you me.
{28412}{28447}I'm really not.
{28477}{28506}This one?
{28620}{28673}I've shown you every dress we have.
{28679}{28773}Unless you want her to spend eternity|in a lemon-yellow pantsuit. . .
{28779}{28830}. . .go with the burgundy.
{28845}{28925}Whatever we pick, she would've|told us it's the wrong one.
{28931}{28983}You're right.|We'll go with the burgundy.
{28989}{29055}A fine choice. I'm coming out.
{29060}{29101}Wait! We need shoes.
{29307}{29330}How about these?
{29347}{29387}That's really a day shoe.
{29393}{29467}And where she's going,|everyone else will be dressier?
{29502}{29562}Could we see something|in a slimmer heel?
{29672}{29775}I have nothing in an evening shoe|in the burgundy.
{29800}{29865}I can show you something|in a silver that may work.
{29891}{29942}No, it really should be burgundy.
{29951}{30003}Unless we go with a different dress.
{30009}{30056}No, no, no. Watch this.
{30062}{30139}Wait, I may have something in the back.
{30445}{30475}Oh, my God.
{30488}{30527}Is everything all right?
{30597}{30647}Just Nana's stuff.
{31094}{31131}How we doing?|You guys ready?
{31137}{31203}Mom called to remind me|not to wear my hair up.
{31209}{31265}Did you know my ears were not|my best feature?
{31271}{31325}Some days it's all I can think about.
{31346}{31418}Hi! I'm sorry I'm late.|I couldn't find my bearings.
{31432}{31468}You mean your earrings?
{31482}{31511}What did I say?
{31567}{31644}-Are these the shoes?|-Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
{31652}{31723}What? We don't have shoes here?
{31776}{31819}Morning. We ready to go?
{31825}{31872}Don't we look nice all dressed up?
{31915}{31968}It's stuff like that, isn't it?
{32254}{32329}-It was a really beautiful service.|-It really was.
{32380}{32420}Come here, sweetheart.
{32503}{32523}You know. . .
{32550}{32620}. . .I think it's time for you|to start using night cream.
{32772}{32792}What?
{32797}{32882}Nothing. Just your overcoat sounds|remarkably like Brent Musburger.
{32914}{32973}Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.
{32999}{33050}You're watching football at a funeral?
{33056}{33145}No, it's the pregame.|I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
{33167}{33225}You're a frightening, frightening man.
{33249}{33326}Oh, no! My new Paolo shoes!
{33332}{33375}I hope they're not ruined.
{33466}{33527}God, what a great day!
{33546}{33596}What? Weatherwise.
{33630}{33664}I know.
{33679}{33738}The air, the trees.
{33751}{33850}Even though Nana's gone,|there's something almost life--
{33899}{33945}Ross, are you okay?
{33951}{33983}No, I'm fine.
{34013}{34050}Just. . .
{34056}{34113}. . .having my worst fear|realized, but. . . .
{34314}{34387}I'm just checking to see|if the muscle's in spasm.
{34422}{34488}-What? What is it?|-You missed a belt loop.
{34542}{34593}Okay, it's in spasm.
{34620}{34662}Here, sweetie. Here.
{34668}{34719}I took these when I had|my golfing accident.
{34727}{34749}Thanks, Mom.
{34952}{34979}Sorry.
{35001}{35038}Hi, I'm Andrea.
{35049}{35095}I'm Dorothy's daughter.
{35100}{35185}Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have|no idea who Dorothy is.
{35257}{35294}Look who's up!
{35328}{35349}How do you feel?
{35385}{35418}I feel great.
{35457}{35512}I feel great. I feel great.
{35550}{35597}Wow, those pills really worked.
{35607}{35676}Yeah. Not the first two,|but the second two. . . .
{35762}{35802}I love you guys.
{35841}{35923}You guys are the greatest.|I love my sister.
{35929}{35982}I love Pheebs.
{36002}{36034}That's so nice.
{36102}{36126}I love you, man.
{36170}{36230}And listen,|if you wanna be gay, be gay!
{36308}{36348}It doesn't matter to me.
{36390}{36415}You were right.
{36712}{36784}I love you the most.
{36821}{36905}Well, you know who I love the most?
{36942}{36971}You!
{37022}{37070}Oh, you don't get it!
{37222}{37255}What do you got there?
{37264}{37337}Just a hearing disability.
{37364}{37385}What's the score?
{37423}{37498}1 7-1 4, Giants.|Three minutes to go in the third.
{37504}{37529}Beautiful!
{37742}{37825}Pheebs, could you maybe|hand me a cracker?
{37889}{37935}Your grandmother would've hated this.
{37960}{38031}Well, sure. What with it|being her funeral and all.
{38086}{38141}No, I'd be hearing about. . .
{38147}{38211}. . .why didn't I get|the honey-glazed ham.
{38217}{38303}Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.|If I spent more, she'd say. . .
{38310}{38390}. . . ''Why waste your money?|I don't need flowers, I'm dead. ''
{38412}{38453}That sounds like Nana.
{38489}{38550}Do you know what it's like|to grow up. . .
{38564}{38669}. . .with someone who is critical|of every single thing you say?
{38732}{38760}I can imagine.
{38789}{38858}I tell you, it's a wonder|your mother turned out. . .
{38864}{38939}. . .to be the positive,|life-affirming person she is.
{38982}{39030}That is a wonder!
{39092}{39207}So tell me something, Mom.|If you had to do it all over again. . .
{39213}{39286}. . .I mean, if she was here right now. . .
{39299}{39328}. . .would you tell her?
{39347}{39367}Tell her what?
{39402}{39510}How she drove you crazy,|picking on every little detail.
{39520}{39565}Like your hair, for example.
{39585}{39672}I'm not sure I know|what you're getting at.
{39707}{39793}Would things have been better|if you'd just told her the truth?
{39960}{40015}I think some things are|better left unsaid.
{40021}{40090}I think it's nicer when people|just get along.
{40190}{40215}More wine?
{40226}{40265}Oh, I think so.
{40462}{40527}Those earrings look|really lovely on you.
{40581}{40609}Thank you.
{40632}{40659}They're yours.
{40682}{40731}Actually, they were Nana's.
{40842}{40885}Now I'm depressed!
{40992}{41045}Even more than I was.
{41231}{41280}Hey, who's this little naked guy?
{41285}{41336}That little naked guy would be me.
{41377}{41417}Look at the little thing!
{41485}{41547}Yes, fine.|That is my penis.
{41566}{41610}Can we be grownups now?
{41627}{41661}Who are those people?
{41667}{41687}Got me.
{41694}{41755}That's Nana right there in the middle.
{41781}{41809}Yeah, let's see.
{41815}{41879}''Me and the gang at Java Joe's. ''
{41884}{41936}Monica, you look just like|your grandmother.
{41942}{41970}How old was she there?
{41975}{42021}Let's see, '' 1 939. ''
{42036}{42075}Twenty-four, twenty-five.
{42107}{42149}It looks like a fun gang.
{42290}{42366}Look, look, look!|I got Monica naked!
{42371}{42407}Let me see!
{42460}{42515}No, no. That would be me again.
{42632}{42688}I'm just trying something.
{42960}{42984}Hey, Lowell.
{42992}{43024}Oh, hey, Chandler.
{43077}{43136}So how's it going in|Financial Services?
{43142}{43221}It's like Mardi gras without|the papier-m�ch� heads.
{43227}{43253}How about you?
{43258}{43305}Good. Good. Listen. . .
{43350}{43425}. . .I don't know what Shelly told you|about me, but. . .
{43452}{43485}. . .I'm not.
{43512}{43565}I know. That's what I told her.
{43577}{43605}Really?
{43637}{43679}So you can tell?
{43724}{43829}Pretty much. Most of the time.|We have a kind of radar.
{43876}{43921}So you don't think I have. . .
{43926}{43947}. . .a quaIity?
{43967}{44063}Speaking for my people,|I'd have to say no.
{44124}{44202}By the way, your friend, Brian,|from Payroll? He is.
{44217}{44241}He is?
{44246}{44292}And way out of your league.
{44382}{44420}Out of my league!
{44426}{44525}I could get a Brian. If I wanted to|get a Brian, I could get a Brian.
{44534}{44575}Hey, Brian.
