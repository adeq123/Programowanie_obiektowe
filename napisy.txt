{2339}{2432}It's hard to enjoy Ramen noodles|after that. Is that ridiculous?
{2438}{2500}Can you believe she actually|thought that?
{2629}{2691}When I first met you,|I thought maybe. . .
{2697}{2723}. . .possibly. . .
{2729}{2754}. . .you might be.
{2785}{2805}You did?
{2811}{2891}Then you spent Phoebe's birthday|party talking to my breasts. . .
{2897}{2940}. . .so then I figured maybe not.
{2981}{3100}Did any of the rest of you guys|think that when you first met me?
{3105}{3132}-I did.|-I think so.
{3197}{3246}-Not me.|-No, no, me neither.

{3352}{3387}You're kidding.
{3398}{3449}-Did you tell her I wasn't?|-No.
{3479}{3541}It's because I wanted|to go out with her too.
{3546}{3628}So I told her, actually,|you were seeing Bernie Spellman. . .
{3689}{3720}. . .who also liked her.
{3840}{3885}Well, this is fascinating.
{3904}{3945}So what is it about me?

{4901}{4971}So he's calling from Rome.|I could do that.
{4984}{5023}Just gotta go to Rome.
{5091}{5156}Your Dad just beeped in.|Can you make it quick?
{5162}{5200}I'm talking to Rome.

{6459}{6520}We are gonna be here a while,|it looks like.
{6525}{6593}We still have boyfriends|and your career to cover.
{6601}{6631}Oh, God!
{6793}{6875}The fuzzy little mints|at the bottom of her purse.

{6967}{7010}You know what I love?
{7015}{7059}Her Sweet 'N Lows.
{7064}{7141}How she was always stealing them|from restaurants.

{7238}{7258}Mrs. Geller?
{7402}{7434}She looks so small.
{7445}{7470}I know.
{7497}{7580}Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop|and Aunt Phyllis now.
{7671}{7708}Goodbye, Nana.
{7884}{7904}Bye, Nana.
{8064}{8090}Nurse!
{8126}{8158}What is going on?
{8179}{8245}You know how the nurse said|Nana had passed?

{8326}{8346}What?
{8351}{8442}She's not passed!|She's present! She's back!
{8451}{8478}What's going on?
{8484}{8524}She may have died.
{8544}{8575}''She may have died''?
{8581}{8612}We're looking into it.
{8659}{8696}I'll go see.
{8770}{8811}This almost never happens.
{9230}{9281}Now she's passed.
{9514}{9567}I just have to know, okay?
{9581}{9611}Is it my hair?
{9625}{9698}Yes, that's exactly what it is.|It's your hair.
{9704}{9756}Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
{9922}{9953}So did she. . .?
{9967}{9998}Twice.
{10050}{10090}Oh, that sucks.
{10145}{10171}You guys okay?
{10182}{10221}I don't know. It's weird.
{10227}{10311}I know she's gone,|but I just don't feel. . . .
{10319}{10364}Maybe she's not really gone.
{10369}{10405}No, no, she's gone.
{10427}{10458}We checked.
{10469}{10494}A lot.
{10527}{10596}No, I mean, maybe no one|ever really goes.
{10602}{10671}Ever since my mom died,|every now and then. . .
{10677}{10767}. . .I get this feeling that she's,|like, right here, you know?
{10864}{10925}And Debbie, my best friend|from junior high. . .
{10930}{11005}. . .got struck by lightning|on a miniature golf course.
{11037}{11096}I always get this strong|Debbie vibe. . .
{11102}{11160}. . .whenever I use|a little yellow pencil.
{11284}{11303}I miss her.
{11332}{11361}Here, Pheebs.
{11367}{11391}Want this?
{11397}{11446}-Oh, thanks.|-Sure.
{11452}{11505}I just sharpened her this morning.
{11560}{11635}I don't believe any of that.|I think when you're dead. . .
{11641}{11701}. . .you're dead. You're gone.|You're worm food.
{11804}{11845}So Chandler looks gay, huh?
{11947}{12015}I don't know who this is,|but it's not Debbie.
{12199}{12245}I thought it'd be a closed casket.
{12250}{12321}Well, that doesn't mean|she can't look nice.
{12439}{12501}Sweetie, you think|you can get in there?
{12511}{12552}I don't see why not.
{13012}{13040}Here's my retainer!
{13269}{13309}I was just thinking. . .
{13317}{13362}-. . .when my time comes--|-Dad!

{13595}{13615}You what?
{13637}{13714}I wanna be buried at sea.|It looks like fun.
{13769}{13800}Define ''fun. ''
{13805}{13904}Come on. You'll make a day of it.|You'll get a boat, pack a lunch. . . .
{13911}{14015}And then we throw your body in|the water. Gee, that does sound fun.
{14020}{14056}Everyone thinks they know me.
{14062}{14136}Everyone says, ''Jack Geller,|so predictable. ''
{14142}{14256}Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say,|''Buried at sea? Huh. ''
{14337}{14387}That's probably what they'll say.
{14400}{14438}I'd like that.
{14724}{14744}Hey, gorgeous.
{14785}{14851}Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.
{14857}{14960}Don't worry about it. Apparently,|other people have made the same mistake.
{14990}{15031}Okay. Phew!
{15099}{15163}So what do you think it is about me?
{15191}{15220}I don't know what.
{15225}{15270}You just have. . .
{15275}{15320}-. . .a quality.|-A quality. Great.
{15332}{15421}It's a shame, because you and Lowell|would've made a great couple.
{15465}{15564}Lowell? Financial Services Lowell?|That's who you saw me with?
{15571}{15597}What? He's cute.
{15603}{15635}Well, yeah.
{15644}{15693}He's no Brian in Payroll.
{15765}{15790}Is Brian. . .?
{15796}{15880}I don't know. The point is,|if you were gonna set me up. . .
{15885}{15954}. . .I'd like to think it'd be|with somebody like him.
{15959}{16019}I think Brian's|a little out of your league.
{16142}{16236}Excuse me. You don't think|I could get a Brian?
{16307}{16386}Because I could get a Brian.|Believe you me.
{16427}{16462}I'm really not.
{16492}{16521}This one?
{16635}{16688}I've shown you every dress we have.
{16694}{16788}Unless you want her to spend eternity|in a lemon-yellow pantsuit. . .
{16794}{16845}. . .go with the burgundy.
{16860}{16940}Whatever we pick, she would've|told us it's the wrong one.
{16946}{16998}You're right.|We'll go with the burgundy.
{17004}{17070}A fine choice. I'm coming out.
{17075}{17116}Wait! We need shoes.
{17322}{17345}How about these?
{17362}{17402}That's really a day shoe.
{17408}{17482}And where she's going,|everyone else will be dressier?
{17517}{17577}Could we see something|in a slimmer heel?
{17687}{17790}I have nothing in an evening shoe|in the burgundy.
{17815}{17880}I can show you something|in a silver that may work.
{17906}{17957}No, it really should be burgundy.
{17966}{18018}Unless we go with a different dress.
{18024}{18071}No, no, no. Watch this.
{18077}{18154}Wait, I may have something in the back.
{18460}{18490}Oh, my God.
{18503}{18542}Is everything all right?
{18612}{18662}Just Nana's stuff.
{19109}{19146}How we doing?|You guys ready?
{19152}{19218}Mom called to remind me|not to wear my hair up.
{19224}{19280}Did you know my ears were not|my best feature?
{19286}{19340}Some days it's all I can think about.
{19361}{19433}Hi! I'm sorry I'm late.|I couldn't find my bearings.
{19447}{19483}You mean your earrings?
{19497}{19526}What did I say?
{19582}{19659}-Are these the shoes?|-Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
{19667}{19738}What? We don't have shoes here?
{19791}{19834}Morning. We ready to go?
{19840}{19887}Don't we look nice all dressed up?
{19930}{19983}It's stuff like that, isn't it?
{20269}{20344}-It was a really beautiful service.|-It really was.
{20395}{20435}Come here, sweetheart.
{20518}{20538}You know. . .
{20565}{20635}. . .I think it's time for you|to start using night cream.
{20787}{20807}What?
{20812}{20897}Nothing. Just your overcoat sounds|remarkably like Brent Musburger.
{20929}{20988}Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.
{21014}{21065}You're watching football at a funeral?
{21071}{21160}No, it's the pregame.|I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
{21182}{21240}You're a frightening, frightening man.
{21264}{21341}Oh, no! My new Paolo shoes!

{21481}{21542}God, what a great day!
{21561}{21611}What? Weatherwise.
{21645}{21679}I know.
{21694}{21753}The air, the trees.
{21766}{21865}Even though Nana's gone,|there's something almost life--
{21914}{21960}Ross, are you okay?
{21966}{21998}No, I'm fine.
{22028}{22065}Just. . .
{22071}{22128}. . .having my worst fear|realized, but. . . .
{22329}{22402}I'm just checking to see|if the muscle's in spasm.
{22437}{22503}-What? What is it?|-You missed a belt loop.
{22557}{22608}Okay, it's in spasm.
{22635}{22677}Here, sweetie. Here.
{22683}{22734}I took these when I had|my golfing accident.
{22742}{22764}Thanks, Mom.
{22967}{22994}Sorry.
{23016}{23053}Hi, I'm Andrea.

{23343}{23364}How do you feel?
{23400}{23433}I feel great.

{23565}{23612}Wow, those pills really worked.
{23622}{23691}Yeah. Not the first two,|but the second two. . . .

{23856}{23938}You guys are the greatest.|I love my sister.

{24323}{24363}It doesn't matter to me.
{24405}{24430}You were right.

{25037}{25085}Oh, you don't get it!
{25237}{25270}What do you got there?
{25279}{25352}Just a hearing disability.
{25379}{25400}What's the score?
{25438}{25513}1 7-1 4, Giants.|Three minutes to go in the third.
{25519}{25544}Beautiful!
{25757}{25840}Pheebs, could you maybe|hand me a cracker?
{25904}{25950}Your grandmother would've hated this.
{25975}{26046}Well, sure. What with it|being her funeral and all.
{26101}{26156}No, I'd be hearing about. . .
{26162}{26226}. . .why didn't I get|the honey-glazed ham.
{26232}{26318}Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.|If I spent more, she'd say. . .
{26325}{26405}. . . ''Why waste your money?|I don't need flowers, I'm dead. ''
{26427}{26468}That sounds like Nana.
{26504}{26565}Do you know what it's like|to grow up. . .
{26579}{26684}. . .with someone who is critical|of every single thing you say?
{26747}{26775}I can imagine.
{26804}{26873}I tell you, it's a wonder|your mother turned out. . .
{26879}{26954}. . .to be the positive,|life-affirming person she is.
{26997}{27045}That is a wonder!
{27107}{27222}So tell me something, Mom.|If you had to do it all over again. . .
{27228}{27301}. . .I mean, if she was here right now. . .
{27314}{27343}. . .would you tell her?
{27362}{27382}Tell her what?
{27417}{27525}How she drove you crazy,|picking on every little detail.
{27535}{27580}Like your hair, for example.
{27600}{27687}I'm not sure I know|what you're getting at.
{27722}{27808}Would things have been better|if you'd just told her the truth?
{27975}{28030}I think some things are|better left unsaid.
{28036}{28105}I think it's nicer when people|just get along.
{28205}{28230}More wine?
{28241}{28280}Oh, I think so.
{28477}{28542}Those earrings look|really lovely on you.
{28596}{28624}Thank you.
{28647}{28674}They're yours.
{28697}{28746}Actually, they were Nana's.
{28857}{28900}Now I'm depressed!
{29007}{29060}Even more than I was.
{29246}{29295}Hey, who's this little naked guy?
{29300}{29351}That little naked guy would be me.
{29392}{29432}Look at the little thing!
{29500}{29562}Yes, fine.|That is my penis.
{29581}{29625}Can we be grownups now?
{29642}{29676}Who are those people?
{29682}{29702}Got me.
{29709}{29770}That's Nana right there in the middle.
{29796}{29824}Yeah, let's see.
{29830}{29894}''Me and the gang at Java Joe's. ''
{29899}{29951}Monica, you look just like|your grandmother.

{30386}{30422}Let me see!
{30475}{30530}No, no. That would be me again.

{30975}{30999}Hey, Lowell.
{31007}{31039}Oh, hey, Chandler.
{31092}{31151}So how's it going in|Financial Services?

{31527}{31580}I know. That's what I told her.
{31592}{31620}Really?
{31652}{31694}So you can tell?
{31739}{31844}Pretty much. Most of the time.|We have a kind of radar.
{31891}{31936}So you don't think I have. . .
{31941}{31962}. . .a quaIity?
{31982}{32078}Speaking for my people,|I'd have to say no.
{32139}{32217}By the way, your friend, Brian,|from Payroll? He is.
{32232}{32256}He is?
{32261}{32307}And way out of your league.
{32397}{32435}Out of my league!
